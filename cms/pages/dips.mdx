    ## **Devcon Improvement Proposals (DIPs)**


    ### **Suggest what we should include, change, or subtract and help improve
    Devcon.**


    **Inspiration:** DIPs are roughly inspired by the more decentralized PEP,
    BIP and [EIP processes]().


    **Goals:** We aim to use open and value-driven Ethereum tech where it makes
    sense and benefits all attendees. We want to encourage collaboration between
    different projects.


    **How to submit a DIP:** [Write a short post on the
    Forum](https://forum.devcon.org/c/dip-discussion/6), share your idea and
    what you need (from us) to make it happen. We discuss and iterate from
    there.


    **What happens then?** You'll make it official by posting it on GitHub, and
    after we accept the DIP, you can get started. Your team will receive Devcon
    tickets to bring your activation or integration to life.


    **Need inspiration?** Check the DIPs we have accepted in the past below! We
    prioritize proposals that are open-source, open to all attendees, value- and
    community-driven. Approval of proposals ultimately lies with the Devcon
    team.
