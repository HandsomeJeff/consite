  Remember, Devcon is different from [Devconnect](https://devconnect.org
  "Devconnect") with its goals being cross-collaboration, reduction of silos,
  and being together for 4 days in one place, one venue. We encourage any
  daytime side events to take place before or after Devcon event days.
devcon_week:
  about: "## **Devcon Week Calendar**\n\n### This calendar highlights selected events organized **independently** by the broader Ethereum community before and after Devcon. It doesnâ€™t feature side events during Devcon days because Devcon has full-day programming that you don't want to miss.\n\n**Plan your trip to Bangkok**\L\n\nUse this calendar to decide when to arrive in Bangkok and maximize your Devcon experience. Check the schedule and the **[City Guide](/city-guide)** and start planning today.\n\n<Buttons\n  Button={[\n    { text: \"City Guide\", url: \"/city-guide\", color: \"orange-1\" },\n    { text: \"Get Tickets\", url: \"/tickets\", color: \"orange-1\" }\n  ]}\n/>\n"
